--  Reponse handler for bridging a current call (active channel) to another
--  active call. This is used for performing attended transfers.
--
--  Typically this handler will bridge an active (as in speaking with a human)
--  call with a parked call.
--
--  Returns: HTTP 404 Not found and a JSON body any of the calls are not found.
--           HTTP 200 OK and a JSON body otherwise.
