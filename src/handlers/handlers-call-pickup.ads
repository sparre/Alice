--  Reponse handler for transferring a current call (channel) to another
--  extension. This is, in our case, used to redirect active inbound calls
--  to local peers (users) - or more correctly, picking them up.
--
--  Pickup either the oldest call in the queue, or the call identified by
--  the call_id GET parameter.
--
--  Parameters: call_id
--  Returns: HTTP 404 Not found and a JSON body if the call is not present.
--           HTTP 200 OK and a JSON body otherwise.
